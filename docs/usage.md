## Helper tools
### Speed zones autofill

There is an option to populate all speed limit glyphs within a speed zone.
The first instruction in the zone must have a speed limit.  
Select the instruction and go to `Edit -> Fill zone speed limit`


![alt text](img/spd-autofill-before.png){ width="250" }
![alt text](img/spd-autofill-after.png){ width="250" }  

If there are multiple speed limits within a zone these limits are respected for consecutive instructions. On the speed limit change instruction a previous speed limit end glyph is added.

Last instruction (FZ,FT,FN) is populated with speed limit end glyph

If 2 zones are one exactly after another, both zones will be filled as if it was a speed limit change.

Click on an instruction to get street-view of that point
