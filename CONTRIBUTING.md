## Glyphs

All glyphs must be placed under src/svg/glyphs

All glyph templates must be placed under src/svg/

You need to run the svg convertion script for the application to have access to new glyphs. The script converts all text in SVG files to paths to ensure font independance on various platforms.
```bash
# Generate SVGs
npm run convert-svg
```

### Autogenerated glyphs
Speed limits, Speed limit ends and distances are generated using a script in the utils folder. If there is a need for more speed limit or distance glyphs modify this script.

Run from project root
```bash
./utils/mkglyphs.sh
```
