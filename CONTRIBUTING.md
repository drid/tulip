# Contributing to Tulip

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tulip! Contributions of all kinds‚Äîbug fixes, feature additions, documentation improvements‚Äîare welcome.

## üõ† Where to Contribute

üö® **Important**: Please submit contributions to the **GitLab repository** at  
[https://gitlab.com/drid/tulip](https://gitlab.com/drid/tulip).  

The **GitHub repository** is a mirror and does not accept pull requests.

## üí° How to Contribute

### Getting Started
1. **Fork the repository** (on GitLab).
1. **Check the Project Board**: Review the project board and existing issues to understand current tasks and priorities.
2. **Search for Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, search the issue tracker to ensure it hasn't been reported or is being worked on.
3. **Join the Discussion**: Engage in relevant issue threads to express interest or ask questions before starting work.

### Creating Issues
- **Be Descriptive**: Clearly describe the bug or feature, including steps to reproduce (for bugs) or desired functionality (for features).
- **Use Labels**: Apply appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`) to help categorize the issue.
- **Check for Duplicates**: Use the search bar in the issue tracker to confirm no similar issues exist. Reference related issues if applicable.

### Working on Issues
1. **Claim an Issue**: Comment on the issue to indicate your intent to work on it, preventing others from duplicating your effort.
2. **Assign Yourself**: If permitted, assign the issue to yourself to signal ownership.
3. **Coordinate with Maintainers**: For complex issues, discuss your approach with maintainers in the issue thread to align expectations.

### Submitting Merge Requests (MRs)
1. **Link to Issue**: Create a merge request that references the specific issue (e.g., "Fixes #123") to maintain traceability.
2. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `fix/issue-123-bug-description` or `feature/issue-124-new-functionality`) to clarify purpose.
3. **Prevent Conflicts**: Pull the latest changes from the main branch before starting work to avoid merge conflicts.
4. **Single Purpose MRs**: Ensure each MR addresses only one issue to keep changes focused and reviewable.
5. **Check Existing MRs**: Before creating an MR, verify no one else is addressing the same issue by checking open MRs.

### Avoiding Duplicate Work
- **Monitor Open MRs**: Regularly check open merge requests to avoid working on tasks already in progress.
- **Communicate Early**: If you plan to tackle an unassigned issue, comment to claim it or ask if anyone else is working on it.
- **Use Draft MRs**: For work-in-progress, submit a draft MR to signal your ongoing efforts and prevent overlap.
- **Sync with Team**: Participate in discussions (via issues or project channels) to stay informed about others‚Äô contributions.

### Code and Commit Standards
- Follow the project‚Äôs coding style and standards (see [link to style guide, if applicable]).
- Write clear, concise commit messages describing the change and referencing the issue (e.g., "Add feature X #123").
- Include tests and documentation updates where relevant.

### Review Process
- Respond to feedback promptly to keep the review process smooth.
- Ensure your MR passes any automated checks (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) before requesting review.

### Questions?
If you‚Äôre unsure about anything, reach out via the issue tracker or [other communication channel, if applicable]. We‚Äôre happy to help!

## Glyphs

All glyphs must be placed under src/svg/glyphs

All glyph templates must be placed under src/svg/

You need to run the svg convertion script for the application to have access to new glyphs. The script converts all text in SVG files to paths to ensure font independance on various platforms.
```bash
# Generate SVGs
npm run convert-svg
```

### Autogenerated glyphs
Speed limits, Speed limit ends and distances are generated using a script in the utils folder. If there is a need for more speed limit or distance glyphs modify this script.

Run from project root
```bash
./utils/mkglyphs.sh
```

## üîç Code Guidelines

- Follow existing coding styles.
- Keep commits focused and well-described.
- Write clear commit messages.
